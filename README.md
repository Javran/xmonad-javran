xmonad-javran
=============

This is the xmonad config that Javran uses on a daily basis.
It's perhaps on a bit overly complicated side just for fun.

For this to work, you need:

- [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/)
  for providing consistent versions of packages

- [shake](https://shakebuild.com/)
  for building the project

- [dzen](https://github.com/robm/dzen)
  for providing X11 components for showing system or window manager related status
